My Favourite book is Mahabharat. The story mentions the battle of both the families in a place called Kurukshetra, which is situated in north Delhi, Haryana. It mentions the birth of Lord Vishnu in a human form named Krishna, who led the Pandavas t their victory. It seems to have a huge influnce over the Indian people as they consider it a holy text that talks about important figures in history.
